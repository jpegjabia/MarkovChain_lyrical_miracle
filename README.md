# MarkovChain_lyrical_miracle
Creates a markow chain with words as vertices. 
Words are connected to each other depending on the order in which they went in the original text file.
The weight of a particular word is the amount of words which it's connected to. 
Each word is chosen depending on its weight (semi-randomly).
